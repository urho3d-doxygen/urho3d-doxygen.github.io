Optionally auto-includes geometry...">Navigable</a> component. By default the <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_navigable.html" title="Component which tags geometry for inclusion in the navigation mesh. Optionally auto-includes geometry...">Navigable</a> component behaves recursively: geometry from its child nodes will be collected too, unless the recursion is disabled. If possible, physics <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_collision_shape.html" title="Physics collision shape component.">CollisionShape</a> geometry is preferred, however only the triangle mesh, convex hull and box shapes are supported. If no suitable physics geometry is found from a node, static drawable geometry is used instead from <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_static_model.html" title="Static model component.">StaticModel</a> and <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_terrain_patch.html" title="Individually rendered part of a heightmap terrain.">TerrainPatch</a> components if they exist. The LOD level used is the same as for occlusion and raycasts (see <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_static_model.html#abb8b8c987d0e77ca6679f9de1cb7183e">SetOcclusionLodLevel()</a>.</p>
<p >The easiest way to make the whole scene participate in navigation mesh generation is to create the NavigationMesh and Navigable components to the scene root node.</p>
<p >The navigation mesh generation must be triggered manually by calling <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_navigation_mesh.html#a38f762e87f10300096e08666fbafb443">Build()</a>. After the initial build, portions of the mesh can also be rebuilt by specifying a world bounding box for the volume to be rebuilt, but this can not expand the total bounding box size. Once the navigation mesh is built, it will be serialized and deserialized with the scene.</p>
<p >To query for a path between start and end points on the navigation mesh, call <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_navigation_mesh.html#a4ed8d0391be952e57ac51d3b4898ec69">FindPath()</a>.</p>
<p >For a demonstration of the navigation capabilities, check the related sample application (15_Navigation), which features partial navigation mesh rebuilds (objects can be created and deleted) and querying paths.</p>
<p >Navigation meshes may be generated using either Watershed or Monotone triangulation. Watershed will typically produce more polygons that produce more natural paths while monotone is faster to generate but may produce undesirable path artifacts.</p>

Pathfinding weights</h1>
<p >Axis-aligned box regions of the navigation mesh may marked as belonging to specific 'area types' using <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_nav_area.html">NavArea</a> components. The weight for a given area type is assigned using the SetAreaCost(unsigned, float) method of the <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_navigation_mesh.html" title="Navigation mesh component. Collects the navigation geometry from child nodes with the Navigable compo...">NavigationMesh</a> (or <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_dynamic_navigation_mesh.html">DynamicNavigationMesh</a>).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="DynamicNavMesh"></a>
Dynamic Navigation Mesh</h1>
<p >The DetourTileCache library is used to provide a variant of the <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_navigation_mesh.html" title="Navigation mesh component. Collects the navigation geometry from child nodes with the Navigable compo...">NavigationMesh</a> that supports the addition and removal of dynamic obstacles, the trade-off for which is almost twice the memory consumption. However, the addition and removal of obstacles is significantly faster than partially rebuilding a <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_navigation_mesh.html" title="Navigation mesh component. Collects the navigation geometry from child nodes with the Navigable compo...">NavigationMesh</a>.</p>
<p >Obstacles are limited to cylindrical shapes consisting of a radius and height. When an obstacle is added (or enabled) DetourTileCache will use a stored copy of the obstacle free <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_dynamic_navigation_mesh.html">DynamicNavigationMesh</a> to regenerate the relevant tiles.</p>
<p >Changes that cannot be represented in the form of obstacles will require a partial rebuild using the Build() method and have no advantages over rebuilds of the standard <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_navigation_mesh.html" title="Navigation mesh component. Collects the navigation geometry from child nodes with the Navigable compo...">NavigationMesh</a>.</p>
<p >In all other facets the usage of the <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_dynamic_navigation_mesh.html">DynamicNavigationMesh</a> is identical to that of the regular <a class="el" href="class_urho3_d_1_1_navigation_mesh.html" title="Navigation mesh component.

<p >In addition to the basic pathfinding, additional navigation components use the DetourCrowd library for pathfinding between crowd agents and possibility to add dynamic obstacles.
